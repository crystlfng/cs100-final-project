**Title of Project:** 
`
Quiz Maker????
`

**What app do you plan to work on?**
`
The app will allow for the user to create different kinds of quizzes depending on their needs.
The user will be able to input the questions themselves as well as the answers.
They can then choose to take the quiz or make more quizzes.
As of right now, we plan on allowing the user to make multiple choice questions or true or false questions.
`

**Why is it importnet or interesting?**
`
As students ourselves, we are always looking for new ways to improve our learning. 
While there are many quiz makers online, we plan to make one that is simplistic and easy to use. 
`

**What language/tools/technology you plan to use?**
`
We will be coding in C++ and using this repository as a sute for collaboration.
`

**What will be the input/output of your project?**
`
The input will be taken from the user: Questions/Answers and the users choice to Take or Make quizzes. 
Output: Menu and Questions stored in the program by the user.
