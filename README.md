# Quiz Maker
**Uses of application**

The app will allow users to create different forms of quizzes.
The Quiz Maker will prompt users on whether they want to create or take a quiz. On selecting to create, user will be given a list of options that may include; name of quiz, format of the quiz, add/remove question (i.e. multiple choice, T/F, free response), and add/remove student identifiers (i.e. SID, Name, or Class Period). On selecting to take a quiz, user will be a list of quizzes that are available (If none are found we throw a warning and return to selection screen). How the quiz will be given to user is still being thought. 

**Why are we developing this?**

As students ourselves, we are always looking for new ways to improve our learning. While there are many quiz makers online, we plan to make one that is simplistic and easy to use. 

**Tools**

* Project is developed in C++ 
* Github is used for collaboration
> Will add any tools that are implemented into project

**Input/Output**
* Input: user input and imported quizzes
* Output: exported quizzes, quiz to be displayed, and possibly exported answers.
